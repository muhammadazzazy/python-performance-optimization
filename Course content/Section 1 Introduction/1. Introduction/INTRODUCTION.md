# Introduction
*"If you can not measure it, you cannot improve it"* - Lord Kelvin


Welcome to the course!


**Before you start, you should already have basic knowledge of
Python.**


This course is all about performance optimization. The first thing
to do, is to **measure execution time.**
You can do that with a **profiler.** There are different ways to do
profiling in Python, and this course covers some.


After you can measure how long it takes to execute a Python
program or Python function, you can start to optimize. Any of the
profilers will do, as long as you have at least one.


Let's get started!
